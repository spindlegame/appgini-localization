# AppGini Localization Project
This project is not more than an idea at the moment. I try to convert AppGini in a multilingual app, following the model of OSCommerce.

# Idea
I am developping a multilingual app with AppGini and try to make it multilingual in a seamless way, for all envolved: programmers, administrators and users.
The model I have in mind is OSCommerce use of language specific files which hook into the base files for each page.
AppGini has somethings similar with its files in the hook folder.

# Delimitation
Just to make it clear, the generic texts for the App's __user interface__ are largely translated, such as buttons. What is missing is a translation for the custom made fields.
This is neither about automatic language detection. Solutions for this have already been provided.
